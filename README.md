Holberton's Higher Level Programming curriculum has students learn the basics of Python and object-oriented programming. Later down the line, we learn about SQL databases as well as the basics of javascript and web scraping.

Down below are some highlight projects from this repository:

We got our first taste of SQL databases and queries in this project. This one was my personal favorite.
